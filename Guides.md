# Hiding a DVD Drive in File Explorer

To hide a DVD drive in File Explorer, you can either remove the drive letter or modify the registry. 

### Option 1: Remove the Drive Letter (Using Disk Management)

Removing the drive letter will make the drive disappear from File Explorer, but it will still be accessible via the command line or other tools.

#### Steps:

1. **Open Disk Management**: 
   - Search for "disk management" and select the "Create and format hard disk partitions" option.
   
2. **Locate the DVD Drive**: 
   - Identify the DVD drive you want to hide.
   
3. **Change Drive Letter**: 
   - Right-click on the drive and select "Change drive letter and paths".
   
4. **Remove the Drive Letter**: 
   - Click "Remove" and confirm the action.
   
5. **Drive is Hidden**: 
   - The DVD drive will no longer be visible in File Explorer.

### Option 2: Modify the Registry (Using "NoDrives" Entry)

Alternatively, you can modify the registry to hide the drive from File Explorer and other locations like "This PC".
